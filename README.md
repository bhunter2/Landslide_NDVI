# Landslide_NDVI
Final project for GEOG . Team members - Brooke Hunter and Jon Sheppard

For this project, Jon and I will investigate landscape disturbance and vegetation dynamics. We plan to study a landslide that occurred in 2017 Florence, OR just southeast of Florence. We will use a time series of Landsat imagery prior to and after the landslide to look at the initial impact of and subsequent recovery after the disturbance. We will use NDVI as a proxy for vegetation health and coverage to complete a change detection analysis of vegetation. We plan on doing an image analysis to parse the landscape into bare and vegetated patches. @Brooke Hunter (she/her) plans to link this analysis to soil samples she has collected in both vegetated and unvegetated portions of the slide to do a soil carbon inventory (but maybe not in time for the end of the term...).
