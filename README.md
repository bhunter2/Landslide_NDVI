# Landslide_NDVI
Final project for GEOG . Team members - Brooke Hunter and Jon Sheppard

Project Title - Vegetation Analysis of a Deep-seated landslide over time

Team Members - Brooke Hunter and Jon Sheppard

Summary - We will use a time series of Landsat imagery prior to and after the landslide to look at the initial impact of and subsequent recovery after the disturbance. We will use NDVI as a proxy for vegetation health and coverage to complete a change detection analysis of vegetation.

Problem statement - Deep-seated Landslides move massive amount of material, jumbling soil and vegetation as it fails. This causes changes not only to the topography of the landscape but increases the heterogeneity of soil thickness and vegetation.

question(s) and/or objective(s) - How quickly (and where) does vegetation recover after landslides? We will use normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) to quantify vegetation recovery of a deep-seated landslide just south of Florence Oregon that occurred in 2017.

Datasets we will use -  Landsat imagery

Tools/packages we will use - pandas, geopandas, xarray, matplotlib

Planned methodology/approach - NDVI analysis from satellite imagery over time. Then maybe K means clustering for parsing landscape into vegetated and unvegetated. 

Expected outcomes - We will produce a percent vegetation cover of the landslide over time to track recovery after disturbance
