# Landslide_NDVI
Final project for GEOG . Team members - Brooke Hunter and Jon Sheppard

Project Title - Vegetation Analysis of a Deep-seated landslide over time

Team Members - Brooke Hunter and Jon Sheppard

Summary - We will use a time series of Landsat imagery prior to and after the landslide to look at the initial impact of and subsequent recovery after the disturbance. We will use NDVI as a proxy for vegetation health and coverage to complete a change detection analysis of vegetation.
